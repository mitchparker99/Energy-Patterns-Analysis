This project focused on optimizing energy consumption for a company managing water, electricity, and gas across multiple locations. Using Power BI, I developed an interactive dashboard that enables informed decision-making and supports sustainable energy practices.

# Key Challenges

## Monitoring and managing energy usage across various building types and locations.
## Identifying trends, anomalies, and areas for energy efficiency improvements.
## Balancing cost-effectiveness while maintaining efficient operations.

# My Approach
I created a dynamic Power BI dashboard with dedicated sections for water, electricity, and gas, providing insights into:

1. Consumption Trends:

Analyzed usage patterns over time to spot anomalies or seasonal fluctuations.
Example: Investigated water consumption spikes during summer, suggesting potential irrigation inefficiencies or leaks.

2. Cost Insights:

Tracked annual costs and identified savings opportunities.
Example: Highlighted buildings with high energy spending to consider efficiency upgrades or supplier renegotiations.

3. Interactive Exploration:

Added slicers and filters to compare energy use across buildings, locations, and time periods.
Example: Enabled identification of consistently high-consumption buildings for targeted interventions.

# Key Technical Skills

1. Data Preparation: Used Power Query to clean and transform raw data, ensuring accuracy for analysis.
2. Data Modeling: Built relationships between tables for a structured and error-free data model.
3. Custom Calculations: Developed DAX measures for key metrics, including total cost, consumption breakdowns, and cost-efficiency ratios.
4. Visualization: Designed clear, interactive charts with conditional formatting to highlight critical insights, like anomalies or high-consumption areas.

# Insights & Results

## Water Dominates Consumption:

1. Water accounted for 88.49% of total consumption, with stable costs despite usage fluctuations.
2. Suggested potential conservation strategies without significant budget impact.

## Gas Trends:

1. Identified a decline in gas consumption and costs (2016â€“2019).
2. Potential causes: policy changes, infrastructure upgrades, or adoption of renewable energy sources.

## Need for More Data:

### Recommended adding building type and location details for better insights:

1. Benchmarking: Compare consumption across similar buildings (e.g., offices vs. residential).
2. Regional Analysis: Identify usage trends tied to weather or infrastructure differences.

# Impact

This project provided actionable insights for optimizing energy consumption, reducing costs, and promoting sustainability. By leveraging Power BI and my analytical skills, I helped the company take a data-driven approach toward a more efficient and sustainable future.
